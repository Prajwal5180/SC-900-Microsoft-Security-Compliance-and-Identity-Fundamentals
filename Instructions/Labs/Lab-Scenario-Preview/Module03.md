# Lab Scenario Preview: Lab-03 : Microsoft Entra Conditional Access

## Lab overview

In this lab, you will explore conditional access MFA, from the perspective of an admin and a user. As the admin will create a policy that will require a user to go through multi-factor authentication when accessing a cloud-based Microsoft Azure Management application. From a user perspective, you will see the impact of the conditional access policy, including the process to register for MFA.


## Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Reset the password for the user
