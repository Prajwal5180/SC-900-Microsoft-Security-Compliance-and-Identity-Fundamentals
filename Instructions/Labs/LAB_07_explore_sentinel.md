# Lab-07 : Explore Microsoft Sentinel 

## Lab scenario
In this lab you will walk through the process of creating an  Microsoft Sentinel instance.  You will also set up the permissions to ensure access to the resources that will get deployed to support  Microsoft Sentinel.  Once this basic setup is done you will walk through the steps for connecting Microsoft Sentinel to your data sources, set up a workbook, and do a brief walk-through of some of key capabilities available in Microsoft Sentinel. 

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create a Microsoft Sentinel instance
+ Task 2: Built-in Microsoft Sentinel roles
+ Task 3: Data connector to your instance of Microsoft Sentinel
+ Task 4: Explore on capabilities available in Sentinel 

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Task 2: Built-in Microsoft Sentinel roles

With the Microsoft Sentinel instance created, it is important that users that will have responsibility to support Microsoft Sentinel have the necessary permissions.  This is done by assigning the designated user the required role permissions. In this task, you'll view the available, built-in Microsoft Sentinel roles.

1. In the **Search resources, services, and docs** search for **Resource groups (1)** then select **Resource groups (2)** from the search results.

   ![Picture 1](../Images/sc-20.png)

1. From the Resource groups page, select the resource group  with Microsoft Sentinel, **SC900-ResourceGroup**.

   ![Picture 1](../Images/sc-21.png)
   
   >**Note**: Working at the resource group level will ensure that any role that is selected will apply to all the resources that are part of the Microsoft Sentinel instance that was created in the previous task.
  
   >**Note**:  For the Azure subscription provided to you in this lab environment, a role has been defined that will give you access to manage all necessary resources as shown in the description. It is important, however, to understand the available Sentinel specific roles. Note the current role is Owner.
  
   >**NOTE:**  As a best practice you should assign the least privilege required for the role.  As a reference, review permissions in Azure Sentinel: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/roles
   
1. Select the **Access Control (IAM) (1)**, select **View my access (2)** to confirm the **Owner (3)** role has been added, then close the window by select the **X (4)** on the top-right corner of the window.

   ![Picture 1](../Images/sc-22.png)

1. From the Access control page, select the **Roles (1)** tab on the top of the page.

   - In the search box, enter **Microsoft Sentinel (2)** to view the built-in roles associated with Microsoft Sentinel.
  
   - From any of the roles listed **(3)**, select **View (4)** to view the details of that role. As a best practice you should assign the least privilege required for 
       the role.

   - Close the window by selecting the **X (5)** on the top-right corner of the window.
  
     ![Picture 1](../Images/sc-23.png)

    >**Note**: The detailed information.  Microsoft Sentinel uses Fusion, a correlation engine based on scalable machine learning algorithms, to automatically detect multistage attacks (also known as advanced persistent threats) by identifying combinations of anomalous behaviors and suspicious activities that are observed at various stages of the kill chain. On the basis of these discoveries, Microsoft Sentinel generates incidents that would otherwise be difficult to catch **(3)**.
