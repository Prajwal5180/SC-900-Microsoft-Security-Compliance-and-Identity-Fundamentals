# Lab-06: Explore Microsoft Defender for Cloud

## Lab scenario
In this lab, you will explore Microsoft Defender for Cloud and learn how Azure Secure Score can be used to improve your organization's security posture. NOTE: the Azure subscription provided by the Authorized Lab Hoster (ALH) limits access and may experience longer than normal delays.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Explore on Microsoft Defender for Cloud
+ Task 2: How to enable/disable the various Microsoft Defender for Cloud plans

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

## Task 1: Explore on Microsoft Defender for Cloud

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** search for **Microsoft Defender for Cloud (1)**, then from the results list, select **Microsoft Defender for Cloud (2)**.

    ![Picture 1](../Images/sc-62.png)
    
1. From the **Overview** page of Microsoft Defender for Cloud, notice the information available on the page (if you see 0 assessed resources and active recommendations, refresh the browser page, it may take a few minutes).  Information on the top of the page includes the number of Azure subscriptions, the number of Assessed resources, the number of active recommendations, and any security alerts.  On the main body of the page, there are cards representing Security posture, Regulatory compliance, Insights, and more.  Note: The Microsoft Defender for Cloud default policy initiative, which would normally have to be assigned by the admin, has already been assigned as part of the Azure subscription setup. The secure score, however, will show as 0% because there can be up to a 24 hour delay for Azure to reflect an initial score.
